# Coolours

## About

It's a very simple application where you can choose 5 colors and sent the link to your friend or colleague. Also you can copy the code of each individual color

## How it was made

Only with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and [chroma.js](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) library

## Let me try

Press Space to generate colors and click on lock if you want to fix one of colors

[So, just use it](https://itwassoclear.github.io/Coolours/)
